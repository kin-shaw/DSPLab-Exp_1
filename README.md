# DSPLab-Exp_1
Experiments related to the DSP-Lab course, codes of which can be found here. 

All the code for each problem and subproblem can be found in Experiment1.ipynb type of file. Its taken directly from Jupyter Notebook. Audios cannot be transferred hence attaching the .wav files in this folder. This file also contains the graphs produced during the experiment.

All the .wav files need to be downloaded before they can be played, since github does not support playing these files as per my knowledge.

The files below are: 
appended.wav --> Problem 2 where two sinusoids of frequency 600Hz and 660Hz are appended.

Track003.wav & ConvFile3.txt --> Problem 3 where these two files are convolved to give the convulution.wav file.
convolution.wav --> Output Wave of Problem 3.

speech.wav --> Problem 4 Original file before modulation.
modified_speech.wav --> After multiplication of cosine to the original speech.wav file..
